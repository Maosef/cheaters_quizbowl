"I Sing the Body Electric" is a poem by Walt Whitman from his 1855 collection Leaves of Grass.
Its original publication, like the other poems in Leaves of Grass, did not have a title. In fact, the line "I sing the body electric" was not added until the 1867 edition. At the time, "electric" was not yet a commonly used term.
