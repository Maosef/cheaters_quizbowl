North of Boston is a 1914 poetry collection by Robert Frost. It includes two of his most famous poems, "Mending Wall" and "After Apple-Picking". Most of the poems resemble short dramas or dialogues.
North of Boston was published by David Nutt. Following its success, Henry Holt and Company republished Frost's first book, A Boy's Will, in 1915. The New York Times said in a review, "In republishing his first book after his second, Mr. Robert Frost has undertaken the difficult task of competing with himself."
