Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair (Spanish: Veinte poemas de amor y una cancion desesperada) is a collection of romantic poems by the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, first published in 1924 when Neruda was 19. It was Neruda's second published work, and made his name as a poet.
Veinte poemas was controversial for its eroticism, especially considering its author's very young age. Over the decades, Veinte poemas has become Neruda's best-known work, and has sold more than a million copies.  The book has been translated into many languages; in English, the translation was made by poet W. S. Merwin.
In 2001, the alternative rock musician Lynda Thomas released as a single the flamenco song Ay, Ay, Ay, which was based on this work.
