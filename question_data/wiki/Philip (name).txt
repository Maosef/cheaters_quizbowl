Philip is a given name, derived from the Greek Philippos (Philippos, lit. "horse-loving" or "fond of horses"), from a compound of philos (philos, "dear", "loved", "loving") and ippos (hippos, "horse"). In Ancient Greece, the ownership of horses was available only to those rich enough to afford them. Thus, "lover of horses" can also be understood as "noble". Prominent Philips who popularized the name include kings of Macedonia and one of the apostles of early Christianity.
Philip has many alternative spellings, many of them with two Ls (such as Phillips, mostly found as a surname), and also has many diminutive (or hypocoristic forms) including Phil, Flip, Feli, Philly, Lip, Pep or Peps, and Pippo. There are also feminine forms such as Philippine, Philippa. Additionally, there is also; Philippe (from the French name, e.g. Philippe de Gueldres (Philippa of Guelders)).
