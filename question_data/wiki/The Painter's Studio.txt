The Painter's Studio (L'Atelier du peintre): A Real Allegory of a Seven Year Phase in my Artistic and Moral Life is an 1855 oil painting on canvas by Gustave Courbet. It is located in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, France.
Begun in late 1854, he completed it in six weeks. "The world comes to be painted at my studio" said Courbet. The figures in the painting are allegorical representations of various influences on Courbet's artistic life. On the left are human figures from all levels of society. In the center, Courbet works on a landscape, while turned away from a nude model who is a symbol of academic art tradition. On the right are friends and associates of Courbet including writers George Sand and Charles Baudelaire, Champfleury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, collector Alfred Bruyas, and Francois Sabatier and his wife, Caroline Unger. The ghostly female figure visible to the left of Baudelaire (in the right corner of the painting) is believed to be Baudelaire's mistress Jeanne Duval, who Baudelaire requested to be painted over.
The 1855 Paris World Fair's jury accepted eleven of Courbet's work, but refused this one. So, in an act of self promotion Courbet, with the help of Jacques-Louis-Alfred Bruyas, opened his own exhibition close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various Salon des Refuses. Very little praise was forthcoming, and Eugene Delacroix was one of the few painters who supported the work.
Influenced by Diego Velazquez's Las Meninas, this work in turn influenced Edouard Manet in two of his early paintings: The Old Musician and Music in the Tuileries.
